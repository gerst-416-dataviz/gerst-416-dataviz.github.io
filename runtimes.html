    On the left, we now have a scatterplot of runtime (in minutes) versus release year for all movies with at least 5,000 user ratings, again scaled to reflect the number of ratings.<br><br>
    We hope that despite the bias we observed before, we will still be able to make inferences about any trends in movie runtime over the years. Have they gotten longer, shorter, or stayed the same?<br><br>
    Note that the vertical axis is now a logarithmic scale, since the runtimes vary all the way from 45 to nearly 570 minutes long.<br><br>
    Even though we started with a vote threshold of 5,000 votes this time, it's still quite cluttered, since this includes over 16,000 movies.<br><br>
